# Ghulam Qadir

I build backend systems and AI features that are fast, reliable, and easy to live with, enjoy working on AI features when they solve real problems (RAG, search, automation), not just demos.

## What I build
- Backend services with Node.js (Express) and Python (FastAPI)
- AI integrations: RAG, embeddings, OpenAI APIs, vector search
- Real-time + scalable APIs, microservices, and performance tuning
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase + vector tools (Qdrant / FAISS)
- Deployments: Linux, AWS, CI/CD

## Highlights
- Built AI chatbots using RAG + vector search for context-aware answers
- Designed modular backends with clean architecture and role-based access control
- Delivered payment and data workflows with reliability and observability in mind
- Comfortable working across the stack when needed (APIs → integrations → deployment)

## Tech I like using
JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions

## Outside of code
I reset with long walks and a good story — either Assassin’s Creed or a mystery series that actually pays off.  
I’m usually in a YouTube rabbit hole (tech, business, or comedy), and I like keeping up with new system/product updates.  
If there’s a new food spot worth trying, I’m probably there.
