I build backend systems and AI-powered products that feel fast, reliable, and actually useful.
Big fan of clean architecture, practical automation, and shipping things people use.

## What I do
- Backend engineering with Node.js and FastAPI
- AI integrations: RAG, embeddings, OpenAI APIs, vector search
- Real-time + scalable APIs, microservices, and performance tuning
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase + vector DBs (Qdrant / FAISS)

## Highlights
