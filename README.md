# Ghulam Qadir

Backend engineer who likes building calm, stable systems — the kind that don’t wake you up at 3AM.
I enjoy working on AI features when they solve real problems (RAG, search, automation), not just demos.

## What I do
- Backend engineering with Node.js and FastAPI
- AI integrations: RAG, embeddings, OpenAI APIs, vector search
- Real-time + scalable APIs, microservices, and performance tuning
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase + vector DBs (Qdrant / FAISS)

## Highlights
- Built AI chatbots with RAG + vector search for better context-aware answers
- Designed modular backends and clean architecture
- Improved backend performance by removing bottlenecks and optimizing data flows
- Comfortable deploying on Linux + AWS and working end-to-end with teams

## Tech I like using
Node.js, Express, FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Qdrant/FAISS, AWS, GitHub Actions

## Outside of code
I’m pretty laid back — I like good coffee, long walks, and building small side-projects that automate life whenever it hard to find for small stuff.
If I’m not coding, I’m usually watching a movies, reading about Tech news, or trying a new tool.
